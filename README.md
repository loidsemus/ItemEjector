# ItemEjector

ItemEjector is a plugin that lets players add certain items to a blacklist, which will prevent them from being picked up by that player. It is also
possible to choose a maximum amount of an item that is allowed to be picked up. For example, if a player chooses to only be able to pick up 64
cobblestone, dropped cobblestone will still be picked up until 64 is reached in the players' inventory. If the player has 64 **or more (items already
in the inventory, e.g taken from chests, won't be affected)**, no cobblestone will be picked up.

In short, ItemEjector can make playing survival a bit more burden-free by, among other things, preventing the inventory from overflowing with
cobblestone or netherrack when mining.
